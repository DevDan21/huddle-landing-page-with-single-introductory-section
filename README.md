## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learnt how to work with fontawesome icons for the first time. Really simple and easy to implement. Changing of the styling and playing around with the hover states. Working with background images seem to be a bit of a pain for me but I've got to learn and do more research regarding background images. Otherwise this is a simple two-column layout that wasn't too challenging to recreate. I had fun and the design looks friendly.

### Continued development

There are some areas regarding responsiveness that I'd like to continue working on and getting better at.
